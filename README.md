ExpressJS MongoDB Rest-API Demo App

This project marks the beginning of my post-college backend development journey. I've created an Express.js and MongoDB REST API following the dmalvia tutorial, aiming to perfect fundamental backend development skills.

Through this project, I've revised the essentials of building RESTful APIs, including Express.js and MongoDB interactions. While I'm in the early stages of my backend career, this project showcases my commitment to learning and applying knowledge.
